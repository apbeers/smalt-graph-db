# Benchmarks

`npm run bench` runs the same queries on `MemoryStore` and `CsrStore` over a generated social network
(`network(20000)` from `@smaltworks/smaltcy/datasets`: 20,008 nodes and 60,025 relationships), checks that both
stores return the same rows, and reports the median time of 7 runs after one warm-up run.

## Method

- Node 22, one process, both stores in memory.
- Times include parsing and planning each query, as `Graph.run` does.
- `BENCH_PEOPLE` and `BENCH_RUNS` change the size and the number of runs. Results are written to
  `bench/results/<date>.local.json`.

## Results (2026-11-11)

In a cloud container (shared CPU; expect noise of 10–20 %). Milliseconds, median of 7 runs.

| Query | MemoryStore | CsrStore |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Seek a person by name | 0.45 | 0.05 |
| 1 hop | 0.31 | 0.23 |
| 2 hops | 1.89 | 1.22 |
| 3 hops (13,076 rows) | 5.88 | 2.85 |
| Variable length 1..3, distinct | 11.30 | 7.72 |
| Shortest path | 0.22 | 0.10 |
| Label scan and filter | 3.04 | 1.43 |

Loading the graph took 229 ms and building the `CsrStore` from it 155 ms.

- `MemoryStore` seeks without an index here: it scans the label. `CsrStore` indexes every property the first time a
  query looks it up.
- `CsrStore` reads relationships from contiguous typed arrays, which shows from two hops on.
